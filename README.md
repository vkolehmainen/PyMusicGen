#PyMusicGen is a software designed to generate music algorithmically within the boundaries set by the user. The program uses several algorithms including Markov's Chains to simulate rhythm, chord progressions and melody patterns. Music data is output in MIDI-format and can be played in any MIDI-receiver.
